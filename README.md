# Practice_Landing_Bulding(The Box)
Keep learning HTML/CSS. 
Here I practiced:
- SCSS/SASS via VSCode;
- BEM technology;
- PixelPerfect plugin via Chrome;
- pseudo-classes(hover/active/nth);
- pseudo-elements(before/after);
- CSS position (relative/absolute/fixed).  
This design was taken in Figma community.
